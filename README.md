We're designing a smart health care system which takes data of different sensors from different locations on the body. 
We will be developing a system to monitor the exercise one does daily.
By connecting different sensors we predict the type of exercise we're doing. 
We can then predict whether the person is doing the exercise correctly or not. 
We also monitor the heart rate of the person so we can check for his sleeping habits
and if he has irregular heart beats we can warn him against any possible threat to him.
